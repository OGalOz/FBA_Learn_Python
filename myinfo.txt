TD:
When building the stoichiometric matrix- divide reactions into intracellular and extracellular.
  How:
    Define extracellular - does this mean cells are only imported or exported as well?
    If compounds have [e0] in their name - move them to the bottom of the matrix.

Generate objective function ( a reaction column to add to the stoichiometric matrix)




NOTE: TESTING ON (Function in aux_1 not reading entire file)
